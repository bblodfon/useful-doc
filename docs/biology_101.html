<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<h4 id="nucleic-acid">Nucleic Acid</h4>
<p>A complex organic substance present in living cells, especially DNA or RNA, 
whose molecules consist of many nucleotides linked in a long chain.</p>
<h2 id="dna-genes-proteins">DNA, Genes, Proteins</h2>
<h4 id="central-dogma">Central Dogma</h4>
<p>DNA =&gt; RNA =&gt; protein synthesis (one way)</p>
<h4 id="exon">Exon</h4>
<p>After the transcription process, the mRNA is a series of nucleotides that 
includes regions that code for a protein (<strong>exons</strong>) and non-coding regions 
that are called <strong>introns</strong>. The <strong>introns</strong> are removed by <em>RNA splicing</em>. </p>
<h4 id="codon">Codon</h4>
<p>A <strong>three-base</strong> sequence of DNA that <strong>encodes a single amino acid</strong> in the 
genetic code. There are in total 64 codons. 4 of them are special: one codes 
for &quot;start&quot; and three for &quot;stop&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="gene-expression">Gene Expression</h4>
<p><strong>Gene expression</strong> is the process that synthesizes a protein out of an RNA 
strand. It is divided into 2 parts: <strong>transcription</strong> (happens inside the 
nucleus) and <strong>translation</strong> (happens in the cytoplasm of the cell). Watch the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BwWavExcFI" target="_blank">video</a> of the whole process as 
described below:</p>
<p>At <strong>transcription</strong>, the DNA in the gene is used as a template to make a 
<strong>messenger RNA strand (mRNA)</strong> with the help of the <strong>enzyme RNA polymerase</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Initiation stage: the RNA polymerase enzyme recognizes the <strong>promoter region</strong> 
of a gene and binds there (the DNA helix is unwind and opened thus) </li>
<li>Elongation stage: the RNA polymerase enzyme slides down the template DNA 
strand and the complimentary bases pair up (<strong>template polymerization</strong>)</li>
<li>Termination stage: the <strong>terminator region</strong> of the gene is reached and the DNA 
strand, the RNA polymerase and the mRNA dissociate from each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, some modifications are done first to produce 
the mature mRNA:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>intros</strong> (non-coding regions) are removed (RNA splicing)</li>
<li>a 5&apos; cap and a 3&apos; poly-A tail are added (mRNA capping for directionality and 
protection - start 5&apos;, end 3&apos;)</li>
</ul>
<p>At <strong>translation</strong>, the mRNA nuclueotides (the coding region) will be used to 
synthesize the protein. The process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>During initiation, the mRNA strand binds to a <strong>small ribosomal subunit</strong> 
upstream of the start codon</li>
<li>Each aminod acid is brought by a specific transfer RNA molecule (tRNA) which
has an anticodon that uniquely identifies a codon and the corresponding amino 
acid</li>
<li>After the initiator tRNA binds to the start codon, the <strong>large ribosomal 
subunit</strong> binds to form the translation complex. There are 3 distinct regions 
in the large ribosomal subunit: <strong>E, P, A</strong>. The initiator tRNA binds to the 
<strong>P</strong> region</li>
<li>During elongation, a charged tRNA with an amino acid is brought to the <strong>A</strong> 
region and binds to the specified codon through <strong>templated polymerization</strong></li>
<li>Peptide bond forms between the two amino acids of the <strong>P</strong> and <strong>A</strong> regions</li>
<li>The complex slides down one codon to the right and the uncharged tRNA of the 
<strong>E</strong> region exits</li>
<li><strong>A</strong> region opens to accept the next charged tRNA</li>
<li>This elongation procedure continues until a stop codon is reached</li>
<li>Then, a release factor binds to the <strong>A</strong> site at the stop codon and the 
<strong>polypeptide</strong> is released from the tRNA in the <strong>P</strong> region</li>
<li>Lastly the whole complex dissociates</li>
</ul>
<p>The produced polypeptide (protein) may need to be further modified before its 
ready to function (PTM).</p>
<h4 id="promoter">Promoter</h4>
<p><strong>Promoter</strong> is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular 
gene.</p>
<h4 id="terminator">Terminator</h4>
<p>A <strong>transcription terminator</strong> is a section of nucleic acid sequence that marks 
the end of a gene in genomic DNA during transcription. This sequence mediates 
transcriptional termination by providing signals in the newly synthesized 
transcript RNA that trigger processes which release the transcript RNA from 
the transcriptional complex. Release of the transcriptional complex frees RNA 
polymerase and related transcriptional machinery to begin transcription of new 
mRNAs.</p>
<h3 id="isoforms">Isoforms</h3>
<p><strong>Alternative splicing</strong>, or <strong>differential splicing</strong>, is a regulated process
during gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple<br>proteins. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within
or excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that
gene. In that case, we have multiple protein variants that come from the same
gene and are called <strong>isoforms</strong>. Isoforms usually perform the same or similar
biological functions whereas some of them have specialized/unique functions.</p>
<h4 id="homolog-gene">Homolog Gene</h4>
<p>A homologous gene (or <strong>homolog</strong>) is a gene inherited in two species by a 
common ancestor.</p>
<h4 id="protein-dimer">Protein Dimer</h4>
<p>Portein dimer is a macromolecular complex formed by two protein monomers 
(single proteins).  </p>
<ul>
<li>A protein <strong>homodimer</strong> is formed by two identical proteins </li>
<li>A protein <strong>heterodimer</strong> is formed by two different proteins</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="omics-and--ome">-omics and -ome</h4>
<p>Examples: proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteome, 
metabolome, genome, transcriptome.        </p>
<p>The suffix <em>-omics</em> refers to <strong>a field of study</strong>. The <em>-ome</em> refers to 
the totallity of the objects of study in that field. Aim of the study in each 
case is the collective characterization and quantification of these objects 
and how they influence the structure, function and dynamics of an organism.</p>
<h3 id="catalyst">Catalyst</h3>
<p>A substance which when added in a biochemical reaction, can <strong>largely increase
the reaction&apos;s rate</strong>. It acts repeatedly on the reaction and it is not 
consumed. The process enabled by a catalyst is called <strong>catalysis</strong>.            </p>
<h3 id="enzyme">Enzyme</h3>
<p><strong>Enzymes</strong> are macromolecular biological <em>catalysts</em> - they help accelerate
chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called 
<strong>substrates</strong> and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules
known as <strong>products</strong>.  </p>
<h3 id="kinasesphosphorylation">Kinases/Phosphorylation</h3>
<p>A <strong>kinase</strong> is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from
high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process
is known as <strong>phosphorylation</strong>, where the substrate gains a phosphate group 
and the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group.    </p>
<p>A <strong>phosphatase</strong> on the other hand, removes phosphate groups enabling thus the
process of <strong>de-phosphorylation</strong>. </p>
<p>Both phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation can be refered to as form of
<strong>Post-translational modification (PTM)</strong> and are essential to the cell&apos;s
regulatory network.       </p>
<h2 id="wet-lab">Wet-Lab</h2>
<h4 id="chip">ChIP</h4>
<p><strong>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</strong> is a experimental technique used to 
investigate the interaction and map the association between <strong>proteins</strong> and 
<strong>specific genomic regions</strong> such as transcription factors on promoters or 
other DNA binding sites.</p>
<h4 id="xenograft">Xenograft</h4>
<p>Tissue or organ transplant from a donor of a different species from the 
recipient. PDX&apos;s (Patient derived xenografts) is a term that is used for 
cancer tissues derived from human patients to mice for research.</p>
<h4 id="ms">MS</h4>
<p><strong>MS (Mass Spectrometry)</strong> is an analytical lab technique to measure the masses 
within a sample. It has become an important method for the characterization 
and sequencing of the proteins.</p>
<h2 id="cell-singaling">Cell Singaling</h2>
<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>Part of any communication process that governs basic activities of cells and 
coordinates all cell actions.<br>Errors in signaling interactions and cellular information processing are 
responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes.</p>
<h4 id="types">Types</h4>
<ul>
<li>Intracrine </li>
<li>Autocrine</li>
<li>Paracrine (small distance signals)</li>
<li>Endocrine (target distant cells - e.g. produce hormones that travel 
throughout the human body)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="singaling-receptors">Singaling Receptors</h4>
<p>Cells receive information from their neighbors through a class of proteins 
known as <strong>receptors</strong>. Molecules that activate or inhibit receptors are 
called <strong>receptor ligands</strong> - examples are hormones, neurotransmitters, 
cytokines and growth factors.</p>
<h4 id="singaling-pathways">Singaling Pathways</h4>
<p>Often, the behavior of a chain of several interacting cell proteins is altered 
following receptor activation. The entire set of cell changes induced by 
receptor activation is called <strong>a signal transduction mechanism or pathway</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="nfb-signaling">NFB signaling</h4>
<p>NF-kB is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine 
production and cell survival and it plays a key role in regulating the immune 
response to infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>NF-kB signaling in the innate Immune system</li>
<li><strong>dysregulation of NFkB can lead to disease (inflammatory disease, cancer)</strong>, </li>
</ul>
<p>many ways to be activated</p>
<ul>
<li>NF-kB/REL family of proteins</li>
<li>Nf-kB triggers inflammatory gene expression</li>
<li>Inhibitor molecule IkB plays role in singnaling cascade of NFkB, the 
phoshorylation of IKK complex also important for the activation of NF-kB</li>
<li>activation of NF-kB is done by a wide range of signals<ul>
<li>through the TNF receptor</li>
<li>through the TLR/IL-1R superfamily</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>purine, pyrimidine, nucleotide</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="irfjak-stat-signaling">IRF/JAK-STAT Signaling</h4>
<h4 id="cytokines">Cytokines</h4>
<p>A broad and loose category of small proteins used in cell signaling. Cytokines 
have been shown to be involved in autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signaling 
as <strong>immunomodulating agents</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="autophagy">Autophagy</h4>
<ul>
<li>recycle cytoplasmic components</li>
<li>activated by nutrient depravation, need to replace nutrients</li>
<li>a way to attack pathogens (microbes)</li>
<li>autophagy proteins impact multiple aspects of immunity (immune and adaptive)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cell-death-singaling-pathways">Cell Death Singaling Pathways</h2>
<p>4 modes of death: autophagy, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cornification, necrosis</p>
<h4 id="apoptosis">Apoptosis</h4>
<ul>
<li>programmed cell death</li>
<li>pathway activated through activation Casp8</li>
<li>autophagy-dependent death, non-dependent</li>
<li>pyroptosis !!! (to kill intruders)</li>
</ul>
<p>RIPK1 and RIPK3 important for necrosis (MLKL proshorylated instead of Casp8)</p>
