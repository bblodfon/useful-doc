Build/train/produce models that\npredict the first observed synergy (using Harmony Search?), from them the next\none, etc. You end up with many models that can predict all the observed \nsynergies or you try to find out why that cannot happen for example (e.g. \ncontrasting synergies?).

Then, you apply (n+1) drug combinations to\nwin over the resistance (and you do this procedure at more levels to suggest \n3-way, 4-way drug combos and why there might be cancer models that can &#39;win&#39; \nover these models and continue the proliferation).

The -ome refers to\nthe totallity of the objects of study in that field. Aim of the study in each\ncase is the collective characterization and quantification of these objects \nand how they influence the structure, function and dynamics of an organism.\nXenograft\nTissue or organ transplant from a donor of a different species from the \nrecipient. PDX&#39;s (Patient derived xenografts) is a term that is used for \ncancer tissues derived from human patients to mice for research.\nCatalyst\nA substance which when added in a biochemical reaction, can largely increase \nthe reaction&#39;s rate. It acts repeatedly on the reaction and it is not \nconsumed. The process enabled by a catalyst is called catalysis.\nEnzyme\nEnzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts - they help accelerate \nchemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called \nsubstrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules \nknown as products.\nKinases/Phosphorylation\nA kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from \nhigh-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process \nis known as phosphorylation, where the substrate gains a phosphate group \nand the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group.\nA phosphatase on the other hand, removes phosphate groups enabling thus the\nprocess of de-phosphorylation.\nBoth phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation can be refered to as form of\nPost-translational modification (PTM) and are essential to the cell&#39;s \nregulatory network.\nIsoforms\nAlternative splicing, or differential splicing, is a regulated process \nduring gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple \nproteins. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within \nor excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that \ngene. In that case, we have multiple protein variants that come from the same \ngene and are called isoforms. Isoforms usually perform the same or similar \nbiological functions whereas some of them have specialized/unique functions.\nMS\nMS (Mass Spectrometry) is an analytical lab technique to measure the masses \nwithin a sample. It has become an important method for the characterization \nand sequencing of the proteins.\nCell Singaling\nDefinition\nPart of any communication process that governs basic activities of cells and \ncoordinates all cell actions.Errors in signaling interactions and cellular information processing are \nresponsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes.\nTypes\n\nIntracrine \nAutocrine\nParacrine (small distance signals)\nEndocrine (target distant cells - e.g. produce hormones that travel \nthroughout the human body)\n\nSingaling Receptors\nCells receive information from their neighbors through a class of proteins \nknown as receptors. Molecules that activate or inhibit receptors are \ncalled receptor ligands - examples are hormones, neurotransmitters, \ncytokines and growth factors.\nSingaling Pathways\nOften, the behavior of a chain of several interacting cell proteins is altered \nfollowing receptor activation. The entire set of cell changes induced by \nreceptor activation is called a signal transduction mechanism or pathway.\n"}}}
