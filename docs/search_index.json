better between some Linux machines.   \nHere&#39;s what you do: Download the (small) repository mini-nbody:git clone https://github.com/harrism/mini-nbody\nor alternately, copy the nbody.c and and timer.h files \nto the servers you want to test, inside e.g. ~/nbody-mini directory.\nChange nbody.c:add line: printf(&quot;Total time: %0.3f secs\\n&quot;, totalTime);at the end of main() function  \nAlso, IMPORTANT: \nIf you don&#39;t want this benchmark to stress all the CPUs - which is enabled by default (e.g. a machine with 8 cores will show 800% in top command \nif you run this program) you MUST COMMENT\nthis line that uses the OpenMP standard as is below://  #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)\nThus, with the above comment the nbody program will reach 100% (one core only full utilization) and will not bring a production system to its knees by using all the available CPUs!\nRun:\nSRC=nbody.c\nEXE=nbody\ngcc -std=c99 -O3 -fopenmp -DSHMOO -o $EXE $SRC -lm\n./nbody\nNotes:\n\nBy default nbody.c takes as an argument nbodies=30000, so if you want to test for more time, use it as such:./nbody 40000(the larger the value of nbodies, more calculations are needed, so more CPU time). \nOf course be careful to compare the same number of nbodies between different servers with different CPUs.\n\nConclusion: less totalTime for one Core means better CPU (so you can safely say which server is the faster one :)\n"}}}
