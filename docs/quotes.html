days, even well into his old age; and his tendency to show up on his colleagues&apos; 
doorsteps demanding they &quot;open their minds&quot; to mathematical dialogue &#x2014; was one 
of the most prolific mathematicians who ever lived, publishing more 
peer-reviewed papers than any other mathematician in history.</p><p>His secret? According to him, amphetamines. Included here is an excerpt from a 
book published in 1998 by Erd&#xF6;s&apos; de factobiographer, science writer Paul Hoffman, 
which explains Erd&#xF6;s&apos; proclivity for amphetamine use: </p><p>Like all of Erd&#xF6;s&apos;s friends, [fellow mathematician Ronald Graham] was concerned 
about his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erd&#xF6;s $500 that he couldn&apos;t stop 
taking amphetamines for a month. Erd&#xF6;s accepted the challenge, and went cold 
turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up &#x2014; and wrote the $500 off as a 
business expense &#x2014; Erd&#xF6;s said, &quot;You&apos;ve showed me I&apos;m not an addict. But I didn&apos;t 
get any work done. I&apos;d get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. 
I&apos;d have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. <strong>You&apos;ve set mathematics back a 
month.</strong>&quot; He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.<br><em>Paul Erd&#xF6;s</em></p></div></div>
