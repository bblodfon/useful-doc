## DNA, Genes, Proteins

#### Central Dogma

DNA => RNA => protein (one way)

#### Nucleotides                                                                  
                                                                                
**Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids** - they are composed of 
three subunit molecules: a nitrogenous base (also known as nucleobase), a 
five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. 
They serve as the monomer units for forming the nucleic acid polymers 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which are 
essential biomolecules within all life-forms on Earth.

#### Exon

After the transcription process, the mRNA is a series of nucleotides that 
includes regions that code for a protein (**exons**) and non-coding regions 
that are called **introns**. The **introns** are removed by *RNA splicing*. 

#### Codon

A **three-base** sequence of DNA that **encodes a single amino acid** in the 
genetic code. There are in total 64 codons. 4 of them are special: one codes 
for "start" and three for "stop".

#### Gene Expression

**Gene expression** is the process that synthesizes a protein out of an RNA 
strand. It is divided into 2 parts: **transcription** (happens inside the 
nucleus) and **translation** (happens in the cytoplasm of the cell). Watch the 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BwWavExcFI) of the whole process as 
described below:

At **transcription**, the DNA in the gene is used as a template to make a 
**messenger RNA strand (mRNA)** with the help of the **enzyme RNA polymerase**. 
- Initiation stage: the RNA polymerase enzyme recognizes the **promoter region** 
of a gene and binds there (the DNA helix is unwind and opened thus) 
- Elongation stage: the RNA polymerase enzyme slides down the template DNA 
strand and the complimentary bases pair up (**template polymerization**)
- Termination stage: the **terminator region** of the gene is reached and the DNA 
strand, the RNA polymerase and the mRNA dissociate from each other

Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, some modifications are done first to produce 
the mature mRNA:
- **intros** (non-coding regions) are removed (RNA splicing)
- a 5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail are added (mRNA capping for directionality and 
protection - start 5', end 3')

At **translation**, the mRNA nuclueotides (the coding region) will be used to 
synthesize the protein. The process is as follows:
- During initiation, the mRNA strand binds to a **small ribosomal subunit** 
upstream of the start codon
- Each aminod acid is brought by a specific transfer RNA molecule (tRNA) which
has an anticodon that uniquely identifies a codon and the corresponding amino 
acid
- After the initiator tRNA binds to the start codon, the **large ribosomal 
subunit** binds to form the translation complex. There are 3 distinct regions 
in the large ribosomal subunit: **E, P, A**. The initiator tRNA binds to the 
**P** region
- During elongation, a charged tRNA with an amino acid is brought to the **A** 
region and binds to the specified codon through **templated polymerization**
- Peptide bond forms between the two amino acids of the **P** and **A** regions
- The complex slides down one codon to the right and the uncharged tRNA of the 
**E** region exits
- **A** region opens to accept the next charged tRNA
- This elongation procedure continues until a stop codon is reached
- Then, a release factor binds to the **A** site at the stop codon and the 
**polypeptide** is released from the tRNA in the **P** region
- Lastly the whole complex dissociates

The produced polypeptide (protein) may need to be further modified before its 
ready to function (PTM).

#### Promoter

**Promoter** is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular 
gene.

#### Terminator

A **transcription terminator** is a section of nucleic acid sequence that marks 
the end of a gene in genomic DNA during transcription. This sequence mediates 
transcriptional termination by providing signals in the newly synthesized 
transcript RNA that trigger processes which release the transcript RNA from 
the transcriptional complex. Release of the transcriptional complex frees RNA 
polymerase and related transcriptional machinery to begin transcription of new 
mRNAs.

#### Isoforms                                                                    
                                                                                
**Alternative splicing**, or **differential splicing**, is a regulated process
during gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple  
proteins. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within
or excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that
gene. In that case, we have multiple protein variants that come from the same
gene and are called **isoforms**. Isoforms usually perform the same or similar
biological functions whereas some of them have specialized/unique functions.

#### Homolog Gene

A homologous gene (or **homolog**) is a gene inherited in two species by a 
common ancestor.

#### Protein Dimer

Portein dimer is a macromolecular complex formed by two protein monomers 
(single proteins).  
- A protein **homodimer** is formed by two identical proteins 
- A protein **heterodimer** is formed by two different proteins

## General

#### -omics and -ome                                                              
                                                                                
Examples: proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteome, 
metabolome, genome, transcriptome.        
                                                                                
The suffix *-omics* refers to **a field of study**. The *-ome* refers to 
the totallity of the objects of study in that field. Aim of the study in each 
case is the collective characterization and quantification of these objects 
and how they influence the structure, function and dynamics of an organism.

#### Catalyst                                                                     
                                                                                
A substance which when added in a biochemical reaction, can **largely increase
the reaction's rate**. It acts repeatedly on the reaction and it is not 
consumed. The process enabled by a catalyst is called **catalysis**.            
                                                                                
#### Enzyme                                                                       
                                                                                
**Enzymes** are macromolecular biological *catalysts* - they help accelerate
chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called 
**substrates** and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules
known as **products**.  
                                                                                
#### Kinases/Phosphorylation                                                      
                                                                                
A **kinase** is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from
high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process
is known as **phosphorylation**, where the substrate gains a phosphate group 
and the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group.    
                                                                                
A **phosphatase** on the other hand, removes phosphate groups enabling thus the
process of **de-phosphorylation**. 
                                                                                
Both phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation can be refered to as form of
**Post-translational modification (PTM)** and are essential to the cell's
regulatory network.       

#### Stem Cells

**Stem cells** are cells that can **differentiate into other types of cells**, 
and can also divide in self-renewal to produce more of the same type of stem 
cells.

#### Cell Death                                                                 
                                                                                
2 modes of cell death: programmed and accidental. Core examples include:  
- Apoptosis                                                                     
  - programmed cell death                                                       
  - pathway activated through activation of **Casp8**                           
- Autophagy                                                                     
  - natural, regulated (programmed) mechanism of the cell that disassembles     
unnecessary or dysfunctional components                                         
  - **recycling** cytoplasmic components                                        
  - usually activated by nutrient depravation (so need to replace nutrients)    
  - a way to attack pathogens (microbes)                                        
- Necrosis                                                                      
  - Result of accident/injury

## Wet-Lab

#### ChIP

**Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)** is a experimental technique used to 
investigate the interaction and map the association between **proteins** and 
**specific genomic regions** such as transcription factors on promoters or 
other DNA binding sites.

#### Xenograft

Tissue or organ transplant from a donor of a different species from the 
recipient. PDX's (Patient derived xenografts) is a term that is used for 
cancer tissues derived from human patients to mice for research.

#### MS

**MS (Mass Spectrometry)** is an analytical lab technique to measure the masses 
within a sample. It has become an important method for the characterization 
and sequencing of the proteins.

#### Flow Cytometry

**Flow cytometry** is a lab technique used to detect and measure physical and 
chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles. Uses for flow 
cytometry include:  
- Cell counting
- Cell sorting
- Determining cell characteristics and function
- Detecting microorganisms
- Biomarker detection
- Diagnosis of health disorders such as blood cancers

## Cell Singaling

#### Definition

Part of any communication process that governs basic activities of cells and 
coordinates all cell actions.  
Errors in signaling interactions and cellular information processing are 
responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes.

#### Types

- Intracrine 
- Autocrine
- Paracrine (small distance signals)
- Endocrine (target distant cells - e.g. produce hormones that travel 
throughout the human body)

#### Singaling Receptors

Cells receive information from their neighbors through a class of proteins 
known as **receptors**. Molecules that activate or inhibit receptors are 
called **receptor ligands** - examples are hormones, neurotransmitters, 
cytokines and growth factors.

#### Singaling Pathways

Often, the behavior of a chain of several interacting cell proteins is altered 
following receptor activation. The entire set of cell changes induced by 
receptor activation is called **a signal transduction mechanism or pathway**.

#### Cytokines                                                                  
                                                                                
A broad and loose category of small proteins used in cell signaling. Cytokines  
have been shown to be involved in autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signaling  
as **immunomodulating agents**.

#### NFB signaling

NF-kB is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine 
production and cell survival and it plays a key role in regulating the immune 
response to infection.

- NF-kB signaling in the innate Immune system
- **dysregulation of NFkB can lead to disease (inflammatory disease, cancer)**, 

many ways to be activated
- NF-kB/REL family of proteins
- NF-kB triggers inflammatory gene expression
- Inhibitor molecule IkB plays role in singnaling cascade of NFkB, the 
phoshorylation of IKK complex also important for the activation of NF-kB
- activation of NF-kB is done by a wide range of signals
  - through the TNF receptor
  - through the TLR/IL-1R superfamily

## Immune System

See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzunOgYHeyg)!

#### Pathogen

Everything (microscopic) that can produce a disease, e.g. an infectious agent, 
or simply a germ. Can be a virus, bacterium, etc.

#### Innate Immunity

Our body's first response to external pathogens. First protection layer is our 
skin!

The comes **inflammation** - a localized physical condition in which part of 
the body becomes reddened, swollen, hot, and often painful, especially as a 
reaction to injury or infection. **Neutrophil swarming** plays an important role 
for this to happen.

- Cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity: **Natural killer (NK) cells**  
These cells detect the absence of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) 
protein presented on **infected cell surfaces**, triggering cytokine release, 
causing lysis or apoptosis.

The pathogens leaves behind unique molecules/traces, called **antigens**. The
**dendritic cells (DCs)** are antigen-presenting cells (also known as accessory
cells) of the mammalian immune system. Their main function is to **process the
antigen material and present it on the cell surface to the Helper T cells** of 
the immune system. So, they act as messengers between the innate and the adaptive
immune systems.

#### White Blood Cells

**White Blood cells (WBCs) or leukocytes** are highly important for the immune 
system (they are like our **defence soldiers**)!  
Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic 
system. They are produced in the **bone marrow** (semi-solid tissue which is 
found within bones). There are **5 major types of leukocytes**. 3 of them are:  
- **Neutrophils** (the ones that swarm into the sites of injury)
- **Lymphocytes** (B and T cells) 
- **Monocytes** (macrophages - they eat the invaders/pathogens, or even our own
cells when they detect that something is wrong - e.g. the cell is cancerous)

#### Adaptive Immunity

- Cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity: **T cells**
  - They come later into the fight (cell-mediated response)
  - **Helper CD4+ T cells** take info from dendritic cells or macrophages and 
either spread it around and call for help (effector T cells) or keep record of 
the antigen for future reference (memory T cells)
  - **CD8+ cytotoxic T cells** are able to kill virus-infected and cancer cells 
directly
- Humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity: **B cells** 
  - They come when the pathogens enter (humoral response)
  - They produce **antibodies** (**immunoglobulin** - Y-shaped protein that 
fits on the antigens in the surface of pathogens and thus tag them for 
destruction - by the macrophages for example)
  - Memory B cells (record the antigen)
- Difference between B and T cells: the receptors that recognise antigenic 
structures
