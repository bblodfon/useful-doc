Regarding the Fermi paradox, from an astronomer at the SETI institute. He 
thinks that the answer to the Fermi paradox might lie not in something complex,
like time and distance, but in *perception*.

# Motivation

> "Young man," he said to me, "do you imagine that everything in my life goes smoothly? Do you suppose I have no troubles, never hesitate and lose confidence in myself? Do you really think faith is always equally strong? All of us have difficult moments; but this is life. Hold up your head, and keep on your appointed path."  
*Leo Tolstoy to Rachmaninoff*

Rachmaninoff was in a depressed state of mind and hadn't composed anything during that period. These words should had help him get up on his feet, but work was just what Rachmaninoff was unable to do at that time.

# Talent vs Genius?

> #### primary::
> "Can an ordinary person imagine things the way you do?"  
"You ask me if an ordinary person, by studying hard, would get to be able to 
imagine these things, like I imagine. Of course! I was an ordinary person who 
had studied hard. There are no miracle people. It just happen they got 
interested in these things and they learned all these stuffs. There are just 
people. There's no talent, special, miracle ability to understand quantum 
mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes 
without practicing and reading and learning and studying, so if you say it 
take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study 
and work and thinking in mathematics, then he has become a scientist."  
*Richard Feynman*

# Work

> #### primary::
> Paul Erdös — well known for his hyperactivity and his habit of working 19-hour 
days, even well into his old age; and his tendency to show up on his colleagues' 
doorsteps demanding they "open their minds" to mathematical dialogue — was one 
of the most prolific mathematicians who ever lived, publishing more 
peer-reviewed papers than any other mathematician in history.

> His secret? According to him, amphetamines. Included here is an excerpt from a 
book published in 1998 by Erdös' de factobiographer, science writer Paul Hoffman, 
which explains Erdös' proclivity for amphetamine use: 

> Like all of Erdös's friends, [fellow mathematician Ronald Graham] was concerned 
about his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erdös $500 that he couldn't stop 
taking amphetamines for a month. Erdös accepted the challenge, and went cold 
turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up — and wrote the $500 off as a 
business expense — Erdös said, "You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't 
get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. 
I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. **You've set mathematics back a 
month.**" He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.  
*Paul Erdös*

> To my wife Anne, without whose silence this book would never have been written.  
*P. K. Dick, The Man in the High Castle*

I really wonder what his wife said about that!

one’s work is terribly important.  
*Bertrand Russell*

> #### info::
> After writing about 20 R packages, I found I had accumulated several utility 
functions that I used across different packages, so I decided to extract them 
into a separate package. Previously I had been using the evil triple-colon ::: 
to access these internal utility functions. Now with xfun, these functions have 
been exported, and more importantly, documented. It should be better to use them 
**under the sun instead of in the dark**.
